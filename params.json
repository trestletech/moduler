Will likely put on npm eventually. For now, you'll need to clone the repo then run `npm install`.\r\n\r\n```\r\ngit clone https://github.com/trestletech/moduler.git\r\ncd moduler\r\nsudo npm install -g\r\n```\r\n\r\nThen the `moduler` command should be available system-wide.\r\n\r\nUsage\r\n-----\r\n\r\nThere current options include:\r\n\r\n - `-d <dir>` the directory containing the node files you want to process.\r\n - `-h` If not present, export the dependency graph as raw JSON. If present, export an HTML file wrapping that JSON which visualizes the graph using d3.\r\n - `-o <outputFile>` If present, will direct the output to the given file name.\r\n\r\n The following would generate an HTML file containing the d3 visualization of the dependency graph of the JavaScript files contained in the \"lib\" directory.\r\n\r\n ```\r\nmoduler -d ./lib/ -h -o \"index.html\"\r\n ```\r\n\r\nToDo\r\n----\r\n\r\n - Setup a proper callback on the file `walk` call.\r\n - Detect extraneous module imports by detecting when the variable to which an imported module is assigned is never again referenced in that file.\r\n\r\nLicense\r\n-------\r\n\r\nThe MIT License (MIT)\r\n\r\nCopyright (c) 2013 Trestle Technology, LLC.\r\n\r\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of\r\nthis software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal in\r\nthe Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights to\r\nuse, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of\r\nthe Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so,\r\nsubject to the following conditions:\r\n\r\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all\r\ncopies or substantial portions of the Software.\r\n\r\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\r\nIMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS\r\nFOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
